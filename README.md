django-moth: Vulnerable web application
=======================================

A set of vulnerable scripts which can be used for testing web application security scanners, teaching web security, etc.

This software should **never be used in a production environment**.

This is a rewrite of the [PHP-based moth web application](https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af-moth).
